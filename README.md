# compressingit


An algorithm that will compress a given data buffer of bytes.

Restrictions:
1. The data_ptr will point to an array of bytes. Each byte will contain a number from 0 to 127 (0x00 to 0x7F). 
   It is common for the data in the buffer to have the same value repeated in the series.
2. Lossless decompression
